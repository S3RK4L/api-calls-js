# Country Explorer
I've built this small project as I love travelling, and am always trying to figure out what to add to my bucket list. This app allows me to explore different countries.

Features:
- Countries in the dropdown have now been ordered alphabetically
- Select any country from the dropdown, and the country's flag and currency is displayed
